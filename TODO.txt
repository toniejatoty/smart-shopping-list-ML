Weight system now is 50k * /10 becouse in kaggle i have 50k product mean is 10 per basket. This preserve from model deciding to give as result only 0.0 probability to all products
Probably higher embedding dim becouse in kaggle there are 120 unique categories in OFF we have much more
Change timestamp becouse for now it points days between b1<->b2  b2<->b3 and so on. On meeting we decided that timestamp are poining days from first purchase


# Jak masz produkt i kategorie to wszystko rzucasz do jednego worka i produkt masz wieksza wage i embeddingujesz
